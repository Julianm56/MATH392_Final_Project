_Fine-Tuning and Comparing Pre-Trained CNN Architecture for Pet Breed Classification_
# MATH 392 Final Project
## Overview:
For this project, we will be fine-tuning and comparing at least two pre-trained CNN models to classify cat and dog images into 37 breeds. For our CNN models we will be using  **MoblieNetV3** and **ResNet18** to do the classification on the dataset Oxford-IIT Pet.
