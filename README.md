# Fine-Tuning and Comparing Pre-Trained CNN Architecture for Pet Breed Classification
### MATH 392 Final Project

## Overview:
--
For this project, we will be fine-tuning and comparing at least two pre-trained CNN models, to classifiy cat and dag images into in 37 breads. For our CNN models we will be using  **MoblieNetV3** and **ResNet18** to do the classification on the data set Oxford-IIT Pet.
